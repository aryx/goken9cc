# -*- org -*-

* TODO
- add 5i/vi (machines or emulators)
- add lex/yacc (generators)
- adapt to goken 7a/7l/7c
- adapt to goken ia/il/ic

* Beta (Q3 2025) (mk/rc, utilities)

** build
- add mk and rc source code from principia softwarica so self-contained repo with
  build-mk.sh to "bootstrap" mk/rc
- add also ed source code from principia softwarica so no need external 'ed' and
  build-mk.sh now build mk, rc, and 'ed'

** internals
- reorg code with all Go related stuff under GO/ (GOSRC/, GOMISC/, GOTEST/)
- reorg code with assemblers/, lib_core/, to match principia-softwarica
  but keep SRC/ with symlinks to mimic old org.
- added lib9/math/ subdir and move files there.

** libs
- added libregexp (needed by mk/rc) and libstring (needed by du) from
  principia softwarica or plan9port

** utilities
- add source code of many utilities (cat, cp, grep, ed, diff, etc.) from
  principia softwarica so easier to build and test for principia readers.

* Alpha (Q2 2025) (Dockerfile/Nix/GHA, mips va/vl/vc, arm64 7a/7c/7l, riscv ia/ic/il)
# see also pad.org history section

** toolchain
- add mips toolchain va/vl/vc from https://bitbucket.org/plan9-from-bell-labs/9-cc.git
  and adapt it to goken; tested va/vl with vi from principia on hello_mips.s
- add arm64 toolchain 7a/7l/7c from https://github.com/inferno-os/inferno-os
  (not tested though)
- add riscv toolchain ia/il/ic from https://github.com/inferno-os/inferno-os
  (not tested though)

** internals
- reorg code with Go related toolchain in GOSRC/ and the C toolchain in src/,
  same for test/ renamed GOTEST/
- start move around Go specific files in GOMISC/ (go editor modes, go shell hooks,
  cgo, go docs, cmd/ebnflint)
- remove the Google (and obsolete) specifics: src/cmd/hgpatch and lib/corereview
- remove support for nacl (google native client old technology superseded by wasm)

** test infra
- add Dockerfile.gosrc and docker.yml GHA (Github Action) CI checks,
  and Dockerfile.alpine (just build, no run; does not run unfortunately)
  and Dockerfile.mksrc (just C toolchain)
- add shell.nix and nix.yml GHA for Linux CI checks (TODO: macOS)
- add basic 'make test' and new tests/s/ and tests/c/

** build
- add mkfiles to better match kencc and plan9 build system
- adapt quietgcc to modern Linux (2025) with recent gcc
- adapt quietgcc to modern macOS (2025) with recent clang
- adapt quietgcc to modern Windows (2025) with recent mingw-gcc

* Goken9cc Pre-history

** Richard Miller: 2020
- cmd/z[alc]/ for RISC-V (later renamed to i[alc] for riscv and j for riscv64)

** Go pre 1.0: 2008-2010
# see DELETED/doc/devel/release.html for a compact list of changes
# see also 'git log' for a very long list of changes.

*** Go->goken9cc:
fork Go at the October 2010 time to start goken9cc (in May 2025).

*** linker
+ Mach-O
+ PE
+ DWARF

*** assembler

*** C compilers

*** runtime
+ Linux (x86, amd64)
+ macOS (amd64)
+ Windows (x86) (amd64 support is post Go 1.0)
+ FreeBSD
+ Android (arm)

*** Inferno and plan9port->Go:
- Import [568][acl] and libbio/ from Inferno-os/utils around june 2008
- Import lib9/ from plan9port around june 2008

** Plan9port: 2001?-2007?
- lib9/ to make portable the plan9 compiler
 
** Inferno-os: 1995-1997
- make portable the plan9 compiler (with help from plan9port) with lib9/
  that can be built ("hosted") from Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, ...

** Plan 9: 1985-2002
Most of the code in goken9cc comes from Plan 9 4th edition:
- cmd/[05678qtv][alc]/ cc/ and libmach/
  a multiarch assembler, linker, C compiler toolchain
- libc/, libbio/
  a new minimalist C library (far smaller than glibc or musl)
- cmd/{mk,rc, acid, ...}
  simplified/redesigned versions of Unix tools
- cmd/{ed,grep,diff,cat, ...} utilities
- libregexp/, libstring/
  minimalist C libraries

** Unix (6th edition at least): 1976
the origin:
- lex
- yacc
